# Neuralchemy Labs

Neuralchemy Labs is the experimental arm of Neuralchemy.  
It focuses on rapid prototyping, technical exploration, and early-stage ideas that may later evolve into full products.

This organization is designed for speed, learning, and iteration.

### 🛰 Orbitcode  
An offline-first coding assistant built for developers who prioritize privacy, local control, and context-aware code generation.  
→ `orbitcode/`

### 📓 Unbuilt Ideas  
A public archive of product and research ideas that have not yet been built.  
Some are exploratory, some are refined, and some may become future projects.  
→ `unbuilt-ideas/`

### 📈 Equitify  
A natural language stock screener that allows users to query financial data using plain English.

## Purpose

Neuralchemy Labs exists to:

- Explore new technical directions  
- Prototype ideas quickly  
- Test assumptions early  
- Learn in public  
- Identify projects worth long-term investment  

Not every experiment will become a product.  
The goal is learning, iteration, and discovery.
