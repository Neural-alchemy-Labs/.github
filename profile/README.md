## What is Neuralchemy Labs?

Neuralchemy Labs is the experimental division of Neuralchemy.  
It focuses on early-stage ideas, research prototypes, and fast technical experiments.

Projects here are not always stable — they exist to:
- Test new ideas  
- Explore new directions  
- Validate assumptions  
- Discover what is worth building long-term

## Active Projects

### 🧠 Poly-Reasoner

[![View Poly-Reasoner](https://img.shields.io/badge/View-Poly--Reasoner-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Neural-alchemy-Labs/poly-reasoner)

A multi-agent, evidence-grounded reasoning system that evaluates ideas from independent perspectives, exposes trade-offs, and highlights uncertainty.  
Designed to help founders, researchers, and builders stress-test decisions before acting on them.

### 🛰 Orbitcode

[![View Orbitcode](https://img.shields.io/badge/View-Orbitcode-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Neural-alchemy-Labs/orbitcode)

An offline-first coding assistant for developers who value privacy and local control.  
Orbitcode runs entirely on your machine and generates context-aware code without sending data to the cloud.

### 📓 Unbuilt Ideas

[![View Unbuilt Ideas](https://img.shields.io/badge/View-Unbuilt--Ideas-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Neural-alchemy-Labs/unbuilt-ideas)

A public archive of ideas that have not yet been built.  
Some are rough, some are refined, and some may evolve into full products over time.

---

### 📈 Equitify

[![View Equitify](https://img.shields.io/badge/View-Equitify-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Neural-alchemy-Labs/equitify)

A natural language stock screener that lets users explore markets using plain English.  
Instead of filters and forms, you describe what you want and Equitify finds it.

## How Labs Works

Neuralchemy Labs follows a simple loop:

1. Build fast  
2. Test early  
3. Learn in public  
4. Iterate or discard  

Not every project survives.  
The goal is learning and discovery, not perfection.

## Main Organization

Projects that mature beyond the experimental stage move to the main organization.
