# Neuralchemy Labs

Rapid experiments, vibecoding, weird ideas, and fast prototypes from Neuralchemy.

This is where ideas move fast, break fast, and sometimes turn into real products.

## Experiments

### 🧠 Poly-Reasoner  
A brutally honest, multi-perspective reviewer that tears ideas apart from every angle using independent agents.

### 🛰 Orbitcode  
A fully offline coding assistant for developers who want privacy, control, and context-aware code generation.

### 📓 Unbuilt Ideas  
A public vault of ideas that came to mind but haven’t been built yet.  
Some are raw. Some are solid. Some might become full products later.

## Philosophy

Neuralchemy Labs is about:
- Fast prototypes  
- Vibecoding  
- Shipping experiments  
- Learning in public  
- Turning chaos into signal  

Some projects die.  
Some evolve.  
Some become real products.
