# Neural Alchemy Labs

My experimental playground for AI, systems, and security projects.

## What This Is

This organization houses my:
- Experiments and prototypes
- Unbuilt ideas and concepts
- Learning projects
- Works in progress

**Not production code.** Think of this as my public lab notebook.

## Projects

### Archived Prototypes
- **promptshield-prototype** - Early AI defense exploration
- **rapture-v1** - Initial adversarial testing experiments

### Active Experiments
- **orbitcode** - AI coding assistant concept
- **polyreasoner** - Multi-agent decision demo
- **unbuilt-ideas** - 30+ project concepts

### Learning Projects
- Various ML/systems implementations

## Philosophy

I believe in:
- Learning in public
- Rapid experimentation
- Sharing half-baked ideas
- Transparent iteration

Some projects here will evolve into production tools. Most won't. That's okay.

## For Production Work

See my main GitHub profile for finished, production-quality projects.
